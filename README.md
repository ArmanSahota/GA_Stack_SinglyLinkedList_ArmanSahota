# Stack Using Singly Linked List
A stack is a fundamental linear data structure that adheres to the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first to be removed. Its utility lies in scenarios where elements need to be accessed and processed in a reverse order, such as in function calls, expression evaluation, and undo mechanisms. The distinction between a stack and a singly linked list lies in their operation order and functionality. A stack restricts insertion and deletion to one end, enforcing a more specialized structure compared to the flexibility of a singly linked list. Stacks are preferable in situations where the reverse order of elements is essential, like managing function calls in recursion or maintaining the history of actions for an undo feature. When choosing between a stack and other data structures, considerations include the need for LIFO behavior, simplicity, and efficient constant-time push and pop operations. Implementing a stack using arrays provides memory efficiency but may face resizing challenges, while a linked list allows dynamic resizing with a potentially higher memory overhead. The choice depends on specific requirements and the expected patterns of push and pop operations.
